# Lokix's nvim config

My own nvim config

## Installation 

if you have nvim config in .config/nvim -> save or delete it

```sh
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/LokiX7/nvim-lua_config nvim
cd nvim/
```
## Requiremnts

 - You need Install a Nerd Font compatible font or patch your own (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for the configuration to work correctly.

 - Your terminal (and tmux) must support true colors for correct scheme work.

 - Maybe you must Install xclip for correct work clipboard buffers
